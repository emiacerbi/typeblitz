This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## To run locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# then
npm run dev
```

You have to setup your .env file like .env.example. Also if you want to store users and statistics, you should have a local postgres db running with the name typeblitz.
